# Task List: GrainKeeper Main Functionality Implementation

Based on the PRD analysis, here are the high-level tasks required to implement the GrainKeeper main functionality:

## Relevant Files

- `lib/services/chatbot-service.ts` - AI chatbot service for farming advice.
- `lib/utils/data-processors.ts` - Utility functions for data processing and calculations.
- `components/predictions/yield-form.tsx` - Main yield prediction form component with simple UI/UX.
- `components/predictions/yield-form.test.tsx` - Unit tests for yield prediction form.
- `components/weather/weather-display.tsx` - Weather information display component.
- `components/weather/weather-display.test.tsx` - Unit tests for weather display.
- `components/chatbot/chatbot-widget.tsx` - Floating chatbot widget component.
- `components/chatbot/chatbot-widget.test.tsx` - Unit tests for chatbot widget.
- `components/map/philippine-map.tsx` - Interactive Philippine map component.
- `components/map/philippine-map.test.tsx` - Unit tests for map component.
- `app/api/predictions/planting-window/route.ts` - API route for 7-day planting window predictions.
- `app/api/weather/route.ts` - API route for weather data fetching.
- `app/api/chatbot/route.ts` - API route for chatbot interactions.
- `app/api/data-import/route.ts` - API route for data import functionality.
- `lib/types/database.ts` - TypeScript types for database entities.
- `lib/types/api.ts` - TypeScript types for API requests/responses.
- `lib/services/philippine-geo-api.ts` - Philippine geographic data service with external API integration.
- `app/api/philippine-provinces/route.ts` - API route for Philippine provinces data.
- `lib/constants/rice-varieties.ts` - Rice variety data and characteristics.

### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.
